Task: Supervised Learning - Decision Trees

Aims: To create a decision tree that predicts the survival of passengers on the titanic. The dataset is split into training, development, and test sets. Different depths of the tree are tested and the accuracy recorded, to find the depth at which the tree is most accurate.
Decision trees are useful as they resemble the way humans make decisions. Supervised learning allows us to create programmes that will be able to predict outcomes based on what it has learnt from previous testing and training data.
